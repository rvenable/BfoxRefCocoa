The biblefox-study plugin was originally stored under the overarching biblefox repository before it was broken up.

A dump file was made of the original repos at revision 166.

From the dump file an intermediary dump file was made which excluded the setup and translation files (because they are data and should not be stored in the plugin)

svndumpfilter \
exclude \
/readingplan/trunk/biblefox-study/setup \
/readingplan/trunk/biblefox-study/translations \
/readingplan/tags/0.1/biblefox-study/setup \
/readingplan/tags/0.1/biblefox-study/translations \
< bf.dump \
> bf-no-rp-setup-trans.dump

The the dumpfile was set to only include the plugin

svndumpfilter \
include \
readingplan \
< bf-no-rp-setup-trans.dump \
> rp.dump

This dumpfile was loaded into the new plugin repos
